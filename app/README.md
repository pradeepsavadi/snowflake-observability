## üöÄ Installation

### Step 1: Create Application Package (Provider/Developer)

If you're deploying this app from source:

```sql
-- Create the application package
CREATE APPLICATION PACKAGE observability_pkg;

-- Create a stage for the app files
CREATE STAGE observability_pkg.app_stage;

-- Upload the app directory to the stage
-- (Use SnowSQL, Snowflake CLI, or Snowsight UI to upload files)
PUT file:///path/to/app/* @observability_pkg.app_stage/app/ AUTO_COMPRESS=FALSE RECURSIVE=TRUE;

-- Create the application package version
ALTER APPLICATION PACKAGE observability_pkg
  ADD VERSION v1_0 USING @observability_pkg.app_stage/app;

-- Set the default release directive
ALTER APPLICATION PACKAGE observability_pkg
  SET DEFAULT RELEASE DIRECTIVE VERSION = v1_0 PATCH = 0;
```

### Step 2: Install the Application (Consumer)

```sql
-- Create the application instance
CREATE APPLICATION snowflake_observability
  FROM APPLICATION PACKAGE observability_pkg
  USING VERSION v1_0;

-- Grant necessary privileges
GRANT IMPORTED PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE SNOWFLAKE TO APPLICATION snowflake_observability;

-- Grant usage on Cortex for AI insights
GRANT USAGE ON DATABASE SNOWFLAKE TO APPLICATION snowflake_observability;
```

### Step 3: Grant Application Roles to Users

```sql
-- Grant admin role to administrators
GRANT APPLICATION ROLE snowflake_observability.app_admin TO ROLE ACCOUNTADMIN;

-- Grant analyst role to data analysts
GRANT APPLICATION ROLE snowflake_observability.app_analyst TO ROLE DATA_ANALYST;

-- Grant viewer role to general users
GRANT APPLICATION ROLE snowflake_observability.app_viewer TO ROLE PUBLIC;
```

### Step 4: Access the Dashboard

1. Navigate to **Data Products** ‚Üí **Apps** in Snowsight
2. Click on **snowflake_observability**
3. Click on the **Streamlit** tab or access via:
   ```sql
   -- View available Streamlit apps
   SHOW STREAMLITS IN APPLICATION snowflake_observability;
   ```

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Application Settings

The dashboard includes customizable settings accessible through the sidebar:

#### üí∞ Cost Configuration
- **Credit Cost**: Your Snowflake credit cost in USD (default: $2.50)
- **Storage Cost**: Storage cost per TB per month (default: $23.00)

#### üìÖ Time Period
- Analysis period: 1, 7, 14, 30, 60, or 90 days (default: 30 days)

#### üö® Alert Thresholds
- **Cost Spike**: Percentage increase to trigger alerts (default: 50%)
- **Query Time**: Long-running query threshold in seconds (default: 300s)
- **Failure Rate**: Query failure rate percentage (default: 10%)
- **Data Freshness**: Data staleness threshold in hours (default: 24h)

### Updating Configuration via SQL

You can also update configuration programmatically:

```sql
-- Update credit cost
CALL snowflake_observability.core.set_config('DEFAULT_CREDIT_COST', 3.0, 'Updated credit cost');

-- Update storage cost
CALL snowflake_observability.core.set_config('DEFAULT_STORAGE_COST', 25.0, 'Updated storage cost');

-- Get current configuration
CALL snowflake_observability.core.get_config('DEFAULT_CREDIT_COST');

-- View all configuration
SELECT * FROM snowflake_observability.core.app_config;
```

## üîê Required Privileges

The application requires the following privileges to function:

### Account Usage Views
- **IMPORTED PRIVILEGES** on SNOWFLAKE database
- Access to SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE schema

### Snowflake Cortex (AI Features)
- **USAGE** on SNOWFLAKE database
- Access to Cortex Complete API

### Optional Privileges
- **EXECUTE TASK** - For future automated reporting and alerting features

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Issue: "No data available"

**Cause:** Account Usage views may not have data yet or privileges not granted correctly.

**Solution:**
```sql
-- Verify privileges
SHOW GRANTS TO APPLICATION snowflake_observability;

-- Grant if missing
GRANT IMPORTED PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE SNOWFLAKE TO APPLICATION snowflake_observability;
```

### Issue: "Cortex AI features not working"

**Cause:** Missing USAGE privilege on SNOWFLAKE database.

**Solution:**
```sql
GRANT USAGE ON DATABASE SNOWFLAKE TO APPLICATION snowflake_observability;
```

### Issue: "Application role not accessible"

**Cause:** Application roles not granted to user roles.

**Solution:**
```sql
-- Grant appropriate application role
GRANT APPLICATION ROLE snowflake_observability.app_analyst TO ROLE YOUR_ROLE;
```

### Issue: "Data appears stale"

**Cause:** Account Usage views have latency (45 minutes to several hours).

**Solution:**
- Wait for data to propagate
- Use "Refresh Data" button in sidebar to clear cache
- Check Account Usage view latency documentation

### Viewing Application Logs

```sql
-- View application logs
SELECT * FROM TABLE(
  snowflake_observability.information_schema.task_history()
) ORDER BY scheduled_time DESC;
```

---

## üìä Data Latency

Account Usage views have varying latency:

| View Type | Typical Latency |
|-----------|----------------|
| Query History | 45 minutes - 3 hours |
| Warehouse Metering | 45 minutes - 3 hours |
| Storage Usage | 24 hours |
| Login History | 2 hours |
| Access History | 2 hours |

The dashboard automatically accounts for this latency in its time-based queries.

---

## üîÑ Upgrading

To upgrade the application to a new version:

```sql
-- Upgrade to new version
ALTER APPLICATION snowflake_observability UPGRADE USING VERSION v1_1;

-- Verify upgrade
SELECT * FROM snowflake_observability.core.setup_status;
```

---

## üóëÔ∏è Uninstallation

To remove the application:

```sql
-- Drop the application
DROP APPLICATION snowflake_observability;

-- Optional: Drop the application package (if you're the provider)
DROP APPLICATION PACKAGE observability_pkg;
```

**Note:** Uninstalling will remove all application data, including configuration and custom settings.
