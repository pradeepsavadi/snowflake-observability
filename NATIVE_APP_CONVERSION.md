## Key Files Created

### 1. manifest.yml
**Purpose:** Defines the Native App structure, privileges, and configuration
**Location:** `app/manifest.yml`
**Key sections:**
- Manifest version and app version
- Artifacts (setup script, README, Streamlit app)
- Privileges required (IMPORTED PRIVILEGES, Cortex access)
- References to Snowflake objects

### 2. setup_script.sql
**Purpose:** SQL script executed during app installation
**Location:** `app/setup_script.sql`
**What it does:**
- Creates application schemas (core, streamlit_app, utils)
- Creates application roles (app_admin, app_analyst, app_viewer)
- Sets up configuration table
- Creates Streamlit object
- Creates helper views for Account Usage access
- Grants privileges to roles

### 3. README.md
**Purpose:** User-facing documentation for app installation and usage
**Location:** `app/README.md`
**Contents:**
- Overview and features
- Prerequisites
- Installation steps
- Configuration options
- Usage instructions
- Troubleshooting

### 4. DEPLOYMENT.md
**Purpose:** Developer guide for packaging and deploying the app
**Location:** `app/DEPLOYMENT.md`
**Contents:**
- Development setup
- Packaging instructions
- Testing procedures
- Marketplace publishing
- Troubleshooting

## Code Changes

### No Code Changes Required! ‚úÖ

The Streamlit application code (`main.py`, `utils.py`, and all page files) **did not require changes**. The code works as-is in the Native App context because:

1. **Imports work correctly** - `utils.py` is in the same directory
2. **Session handling** - `get_snowflake_session()` works in Native Apps
3. **Account Usage access** - Works through IMPORTED PRIVILEGES
4. **Cortex access** - Works through granted USAGE privilege

### Original Code Preserved

The original files in the root directory are kept for:
- Reference and comparison
- Standalone deployment option
- Backward compatibility

---

## Deployment Options

### Option 1: Standalone Streamlit (Original)
**Deploy to:** Snowflake Streamlit (per-account)
**Entry point:** `main.py` in root directory
**Setup:** Manual privilege granting
**Distribution:** Manual deployment per account

### Option 2: Native App (New)
**Deploy to:** Native App Package
**Entry point:** `app/streamlit/main.py` via setup script
**Setup:** Automated via setup_script.sql
**Distribution:** Application package, can be shared/published

---

## Privilege Model

### Standalone Streamlit
- User needs direct access to SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE
- Privileges granted manually
- All users share same access level

### Native App
- App requests IMPORTED PRIVILEGES
- Consumer grants privileges to app, not users
- Three-tier role model:
  - **app_admin**: Full access
  - **app_analyst**: Read access to all features
  - **app_viewer**: Dashboard view only

---

## Installation Comparison

### Standalone Streamlit

```sql
-- Create Streamlit
CREATE STREAMLIT observability_dashboard
  ROOT_LOCATION = '@my_stage'
  MAIN_FILE = 'main.py';

-- Grant access
GRANT IMPORTED PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE SNOWFLAKE TO ROLE SYSADMIN;
```

### Native App

```sql
-- Create app package (one-time, by provider)
CREATE APPLICATION PACKAGE observability_pkg;

-- Install app (by consumer)
CREATE APPLICATION snowflake_observability
  FROM APPLICATION PACKAGE observability_pkg;

-- Grant privileges
GRANT IMPORTED PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE SNOWFLAKE
  TO APPLICATION snowflake_observability;

-- Grant app roles
GRANT APPLICATION ROLE snowflake_observability.app_admin TO ROLE ACCOUNTADMIN;
```

---

## Quick Start for Developers

### 1. Review Structure
```bash
cd app
ls -la
# Should see: manifest.yml, setup_script.sql, README.md, DEPLOYMENT.md
ls -la streamlit/
# Should see: main.py, utils.py, pages/
```

### 2. Package the App
```sql
-- Create package
CREATE APPLICATION PACKAGE observability_pkg;

-- Create stage and upload
CREATE STAGE observability_pkg.app_stage;
PUT file://app/* @observability_pkg.app_stage/ AUTO_COMPRESS=FALSE RECURSIVE=TRUE;

-- Add version
ALTER APPLICATION PACKAGE observability_pkg ADD VERSION V1_0 USING @app_stage;
```

### 3. Test Installation
```sql
-- Install
CREATE APPLICATION snowflake_observability_dev
  FROM APPLICATION PACKAGE observability_pkg
  USING VERSION V1_0;

-- Grant privileges
GRANT IMPORTED PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE SNOWFLAKE TO APPLICATION snowflake_observability_dev;
GRANT USAGE ON DATABASE SNOWFLAKE TO APPLICATION snowflake_observability_dev;

-- Grant roles
GRANT APPLICATION ROLE snowflake_observability_dev.app_admin TO ROLE ACCOUNTADMIN;
```

### 4. Access Dashboard
Navigate to: **Snowsight** ‚Üí **Data Products** ‚Üí **Apps** ‚Üí **snowflake_observability_dev** ‚Üí **Streamlit**

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Files not uploading"
**Solution:** Check stage exists and warehouse is active
```sql
SHOW STAGES IN APPLICATION PACKAGE observability_pkg;
USE WAREHOUSE COMPUTE_WH;
```

### Issue: "Application install fails"
**Solution:** Check setup script for errors
```sql
-- View errors
SHOW APPLICATIONS;
-- Look for error messages in STATUS column
```

### Issue: "Streamlit not showing"
**Solution:** Verify manifest.yml points to correct file
```yaml
default_streamlit: streamlit/main.py  # Correct path
```

### Issue: "No data in dashboards"
**Solution:** Grant Account Usage access
```sql
GRANT IMPORTED PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE SNOWFLAKE TO APPLICATION snowflake_observability_dev;
```

## Migration for Existing Users

If you have the standalone Streamlit app deployed and want to migrate to the Native App:

### Option A: Side-by-Side (Recommended)
1. Deploy Native App alongside existing Streamlit
2. Test Native App thoroughly
3. Migrate users gradually
4. Deprecate standalone version

### Option B: Direct Migration
1. Export any user configurations
2. Drop existing Streamlit app
3. Deploy Native App
4. Import configurations
5. Update user access
