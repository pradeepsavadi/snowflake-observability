- Storage cost: $23/TB/month (configurable)
- Customizable per your Snowflake pricing

### Alert Thresholds
Configure in the `Config` class:
```python
ALERT_COST_SPIKE_PCT = 50  # % increase
ALERT_QUERY_TIME_SEC = 300  # 5 minutes
ALERT_FAILURE_RATE_PCT = 10  # % of queries
ALERT_DATA_FRESHNESS_HOURS = 24
```

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Modular Design
- **SnowflakeQueries**: Centralized query functions organized by domain
- **AIInsightsGenerator**: Cortex Complete integration for AI insights
- **Visualization Components**: Reusable chart and metric components
- **Caching**: 1-hour TTL on expensive queries via `@st.cache_data`

### Data Sources
All data sourced from `SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE`:
- Metering and warehouse history
- Query and task execution logs
- Storage and table metrics
- Access and login history
- Cortex usage logs

### Performance Optimizations
- Efficient SQL with CTEs and aggregations
- Query result caching (1-hour TTL)
- Limit clauses to prevent large result sets
- Parallel data loading where possible

## üõ†Ô∏è Customization

### Adding Custom Metrics
```python
@st.cache_data(ttl=Config.CACHE_TTL)
def get_custom_metric(_self, days):
    query = f"""
    SELECT ... FROM SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE...
    WHERE START_TIME >= DATEADD(DAY, -{days}, CURRENT_DATE())
    """
    return _self.session.sql(query).to_pandas()
```

### Adding Custom Visualizations
```python
def create_custom_chart(data, ...):
    chart = alt.Chart(data).mark_...().encode(...)
    return chart
```

### Customizing AI Prompts
Modify the `generate_insight()` method in `AIInsightsGenerator` class.

## üìù Best Practices

1. **Permissions**: Use a dedicated role with minimal required permissions
2. **Caching**: Leverage built-in caching for frequently accessed data
3. **Time periods**: Start with shorter periods (7-14 days) for faster loading
4. **Scheduling**: Set up automated refreshes via Snowflake tasks if needed
5. **Monitoring**: Track dashboard performance using query history

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Access denied on SNOWFLAKE database"**
- Grant: `GRANT IMPORTED PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE SNOWFLAKE TO ROLE <role>;`

**"View not found: CORTEX_ANALYST_USAGE_HISTORY"**
- Newer views may not be available on all Snowflake accounts
- The dashboard gracefully handles missing views with try/except blocks

**"Slow loading times"**
- Reduce time period selection
- Ensure warehouse size is appropriate (Medium or Large recommended)
- Check query history for long-running dashboard queries

**"AI insights not generating"**
- Ensure Cortex is enabled: `SELECT SYSTEM$CORTEX_AVAILABLE('COMPLETE');`
- Verify role has USAGE on SNOWFLAKE database

## üîê Security Considerations

- Never hardcode credentials
- Use Snowflake secrets management
- Implement role-based access control
- Audit dashboard usage via query history
- Monitor for unusual access patterns

## üö¶ Roadmap

- [ ] Custom alert configurations via UI
- [ ] Export reports to PDF/Excel
- [ ] Integration with external monitoring tools (Datadog, New Relic)
- [ ] Slack/Email notifications for alerts
- [ ] Advanced ML-based anomaly detection
- [ ] Query recommendation engine
- [ ] Cost forecasting with ML
- [ ] DBT project integration
- [ ] Custom metric builder
- [ ] Multi-account aggregation
